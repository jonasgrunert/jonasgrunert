### My skillset

Starting during my bachelors degree I had a keen interest in all things Web development. Starting off with a plain old PHP project I picked up modern web development techniques during the years.

During my masters degree my interest in web development lead me to an interest for developer tooling and experience. This worked together with my growing need to be able to work on large Data Sets due to my studies. My main topic of interest became developer tooling around modern stream processing, web developemnt and compilation.

With a strong foundation in Java and TypeScript I am currently learning Rust and Golang. Additionally I have experience with HTML, CSS and SQL.

My strong side are APIs and integration, as well as being a fast learner and a frontend enthusiast.

### My work experience

During my Bachelor in Business and Computer Science I was able to experience many different areas of software development. In my following work at the Bayer AG, which I did in parallel to my Masters in Data Engineering, I mainly worked as a Fullstack Web Developer.

During my Masters I found my interest in Stream processing and Developer Experience. After completing my degree I took the knowledge of cloud architecture I gathered there to Bayer. I planned and worked closely on the technical side of Data Integration projects.

I am always eager to try out new things and learn about corners of software development I do not know. I see Software Development as the work of a team and value sharing knowledge early and often.
